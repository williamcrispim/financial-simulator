# Financial Simulator
### *Node.js*

The objective of this exercise is to implement a command line program (CLI) that calculates the tax
be paid on profits or losses from operations in the financial stock market.

## Installation

Use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and node package manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the project.

```
npm install
```

## Running 

There are two ways to run the application:

```
node capital-gain.js /file_path.txt
```

### or

```
node capital-gain.js
```

The first one executes the application automatically and returns the expected output.

The second one will wait you to input the **JSON** values, you can put each **JSON** pressing `Enter`. If you want to finish the process and start the calculating process, press `Enter` on a **empty** line.

## How to test?

You can run a couple of tests using the following command:

```
npm run test
```

This command starts the automated unit tests giving you the tests of all the steps.
